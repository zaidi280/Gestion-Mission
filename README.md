# Gestion-Mission
## Introduction
<p>Currently, the management of missions and tasks for different members of the University of Sfax is done manually. In the absence of computer tools, it is difficult to handle these tasks manually, leading to limited communication and additional costs due to the time spent on planning, monitoring, and resource management.

In this context, the University of Sfax has proposed that we design and develop a web application titled "Management of Internal and External Missions" as part of a final year project. The aim is to computerize the tasks of university members, including consultation, assignment, and validation of mission orders, as well as mission requests.</p>
