# Management of Internal and External Missions
## Introduction
<p>Currently, the management of missions and tasks for different members of the University of Sfax is done manually. In the absence of computer tools, it is difficult to handle these tasks manually, leading to limited communication and additional costs due to the time spent on planning, monitoring, and resource management.

In this context, the University of Sfax has proposed that we design and develop a web application titled "Management of Internal and External Missions" as part of a final year project. The aim is to computerize the tasks of university members, including consultation, assignment, and validation of mission orders, as well as mission requests.</p>
## Dependecies
<p>In our project, we used the PHP programming language with the Symfony Framework. For the design of the application, we utilized the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to clearly define the different components of the system and their interactions. Additionally, we employed the MySQL database management system. This combination of PHP, Symfony, and UML allows us to create a robust and easily maintainable application.</p>

## Functionalities
<p>Regarding our application, we present the following main functionalities:

### Mission Management :

- Manage mission requests
- Manage mission orders
- Validate mission requests
- Draft mission reports
- Car Management:

### Manage cars :
- Assign cars and drivers
- Reimbursement Management:
- Manage reimbursements for daily travel allowances
### User Management :
- Manage accounts
- Manage employees
### Tracking Statistics :
- Track the number of missions completed by each employee
- Track the number of missions validated
- Track the number of missions reimbursed
- Track the number of missions performed for each car
### Objective to achieve
Our application titled 'Management of Internal and External Missions' is designed to enhance the process of missions within the University of Sfax. In this context, we present the following main objectives:

- Expense Optimization: Our application ensures better cost management and reduces overall expenses for the institution.
- Improved Efficiency and Productivity: The institution will effectively manage various missions, leading to improved efficiency and 
  productivity.
- Facilitating Communication and Collaboration: The application facilitates communication and collaboration among the different members 
  of the University of Sfax, enhancing the quality of work.
- Easy Access: Our application can centrally manage information, providing easy access and improved visibility for users.
## Actors
An actor is an element that interacts with a system to fulfill a specific need. Actors can take various forms, such as operators, individuals, software, or hardware. They have the ability to exchange, consult, or modify information with the system in question. In the current context, we can identify the following actors:

### Administrator
- Manage user accounts
- Manage employees

### General Secretary
- Manage validation of mission requests
- View statistics

### Employee
- Manage mission requests
- Draft mission reports
- View missions
- View statistics

### Financial Department
- Manage reimbursements
- View calculation notes
- View statistics

### Personnel Department
- Validate mission orders
- View mission reports
- View mission orders

### Fleet Manager
- Manage cars
- Assign cars and drivers

## Conclusion 
As part of this project, we have designed and developed a web application aimed at automating tasks for members of the University of Sfax. This application allows for the consultation, assignment, and validation of mission orders, as well as the management of mission requests.

Regarding the design, we have taken into account the main functionalities, starting with business modeling. We then presented sequence and class diagrams using the UML modeling language.

This work has allowed us to put into practice the theoretical knowledge we acquired throughout our education, as well as to discover new innovative technologies. We also had the opportunity to apply the complete software development cycle and become familiar with the UML modeling language and the Symfony framework.

Our daily internship at the University of Sfax has also been an opportunity to enhance our non-technical skills and improve our communication in a professional environment.

We have also considered our perspective for the future. We plan to implement additional features to enhance the user experience and meet the evolving needs of the University of Sfax. We aim to optimize the application's performance, add reporting modules, prepare an Arabic version for the application, and explore possibilities for integration with other existing systems.

In conclusion, we hope that our efforts will bring this project to life and that we have succeeded in meeting your expectations.
