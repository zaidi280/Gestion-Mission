# Gestion-Mission
## Introduction
<p>Currently, the management of missions and tasks for different members of the University of Sfax is done manually. In the absence of computer tools, it is difficult to handle these tasks manually, leading to limited communication and additional costs due to the time spent on planning, monitoring, and resource management.

In this context, the University of Sfax has proposed that we design and develop a web application titled "Management of Internal and External Missions" as part of a final year project. The aim is to computerize the tasks of university members, including consultation, assignment, and validation of mission orders, as well as mission requests.</p>
## Dependecies
<p>In our project, we used the PHP programming language with the Symfony Framework. For the design of the application, we utilized the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to clearly define the different components of the system and their interactions. Additionally, we employed the MySQL database management system. This combination of PHP, Symfony, and UML allows us to create a robust and easily maintainable application.</p>
## Functionalities
<p>Regarding our application, we present the following main functionalities:

### Mission Management:

- Manage mission requests
